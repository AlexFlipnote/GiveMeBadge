> Keep in mind that it has been moved to [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/GiveMeBadge/releases) to make it easier and better.

## FAQ ‚ùì
| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| The bot does not respond! | You need to keep GiveMeBadge open while you do the command: the application keeps your bot alive.
| My server doesn't popup when I try apply for the badge! |  Is your server a community server? Go to Server Settings and if you see "Enable Community", you need to do that.
| I tried to open the file but it says it's a virus! (PC/VirusTotal) Am I safe? | Yes you are safe! I am just not going to be bothered to pay a lot of money just to sign the application. It's completely safe. Run it with Python if you really do not like the executable file. |
| It gives me SSL error and I can't run the application, help! | Sometimes the compiled version can fail on your machine which is not something I can control, you can either try to run it from the source using Python, or you can use the [mobile version](https://discordactivedev.vercel.app/)

## Usage ‚ú®
1. Click [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/GiveMeBadge/releases) to download.
   - You will need Windows 8 or higher for the .exe to work.
   - If you are on Ubuntu/Debian, the pre-compiled Linux file included should work.
   - If you are on any other Linux or MacOS, download and run the `index.py` file from the src repo (You can download a .zip from the "Code" button) and run it with `python3`. You will also need to install some dependencies with `pip`, you can see them [here](https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/GiveMeBadge/blob/master/requirements.txt).
2. Open application
   - If Windows tells you that it is not secure, it is because I can't be bothered to pay $200 for a digital license to verify my application. If you do not trust the .exe file, you can always run the Python source code instead, both do the same thing to be honest.
3. Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application to paste (`CTRL + V` or `CTRL + Shift + V` or some support it) and **DO NOT** share the token ‚õî, please.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.
4. When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL.
5. Invite the bot in to your server
6. Use the `/hello` command provided to you
   - **NOTE:** I recommend using an alt account to do this step, you do not have to, however it is best to do it, just to be safe.
7. Enter to https://discord.com/developers/active-developer and claim your badge.
   - It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.
