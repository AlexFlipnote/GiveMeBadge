2. Navigate to the [discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications), sign in, and click `New Application`. Choose any name, click accept and create. Next navigate to the `Bot` section and click `Add Bot`.  Click on `Reset Token` and copy the one one.

3. Open the script by double clicking on `GiveMeBadgeWINDOWS.bat` if you're on Windows, and `GiveMeBadgeMAC_LINUX.sh` if you're on Mac/Linux (This will install requirements automatically, and start the bot.).

4. Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application. Some users can also try `CTRL + V` or `CTRL + Shift + V`.
   - **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT share the token! Others can use this to log into your account.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.
7. When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL.
8. Invite the bot in to your server.
9. Within the server, Use the `/hello` command provided to you.
10. Enter to https://discord.com/developers/active-developer and claim your badge.
   - It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.
