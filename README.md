# GiveMeBadge
Pretty simple Discord bot to get the active developer badge

# Requirements
- Discord Bot (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord server that you own
  - (Optional if you want to use source code) Python 3.6 or above

## Usage
1. Enter dist folder and download **GiveMeBadge.exe**
2. Open application
   - If Windows tells you that it is not secure, it is because I can't be bothered to pay for a $200 or something digital license to verify my application. If you do not trust the .exe file, you can always run the Python source code instead, both do the same thing to be honest.
3. Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application to paste (or `CTRL + V`, some support it) and **DO NOT** share the token, please.
4. When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL.
5. Invite the bot in to your server
6. Use the `/hello` command provided to you
   - **NOTE:** I recommend using an alt account to do this step, you do not have to, however it is best to do it, just to be safe.
7. Enter to https://discord.com/developers/active-developer and claim your badge.
   - It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.

## Usage: Source code
Simply run the `index.py` Python file (after installing requirements of course) and then repeast the usage above. The complied version just lets you skip the installing of Python.
