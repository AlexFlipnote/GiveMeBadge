### ‚úèÔ∏è <ins>Step 6:</ins> 
Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application. Some users can also try `CTRL + V` or `CTRL + Shift + V`.
   - **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT share the token! Others can use this to log into your account.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.



### ‚úèÔ∏è <ins>Step 7:</ins> 
When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL to invite the bot in to your server. (***REPEAT: Make sure that your server enabled the Community***)



### ‚úèÔ∏è <ins>Step 8:</ins> 
Within the server, type `/` and use the `/hello` command provided to you.



### ‚úèÔ∏è <ins>Step 9:</ins> 
Go to [This link](https://discord.com/developers/active-developer) and claim your badge.
> It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.
