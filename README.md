4. Open the script by using the command `python index.py` (it might be different, like Linux and MacOS can be using python3)

5. Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application to paste (`CTRL + V` or `CTRL + Shift + V` or some support it) and **DO NOT** share the token.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.
6. When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL.
7. Invite the bot in to your server
8. Use the `/hello` command provided to you
9. Enter to https://discord.com/developers/active-developer and claim your badge.
   - It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.
